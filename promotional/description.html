<p>Use the robots in this puzzle game to complete the task and finish the level. But note that each robot can only execute one command.</p>
<p>The robots in this game are as simple as they can be, but combine the robots and commands smartly and you create a great machine, that can complete the task set.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not a complete game, but only a prototype to explore the core game mechanic. Unfortunately, I only got in two days before the end of the jam and didn't have enough time for a full game. But wanted to present the basic idea, so the game is lacking polish and more levels. Anyway, have fun with the eight playable levels.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Click robots with <strong>left mouse button</strong> to give them commands</p>
<p>Press <strong>space</strong>to toggle between plan and execution mode</p>
